## Welcome to My GitHub! I'm Nahla al Massri ðŸš€ ðŸ‘‹

#### Here are some facts about me 
âœ… Curiosity sparked my entry into the world of codingâ€”my passion began with small projects in Python, which soon turned into full-fledged applications. I knew then that I had found my calling. With 5 years of experience in software development, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in React, Python, Django, and Node.js. My journey has been an exciting blend of problem-solving, creativity, and continuous learning.

âœ… As a Full Stack Developer, Iâ€™ve led projects like AutoVuSolidity, enhancing smart contract security, and NCDP Dashboard, a dynamic app used for managing users and profiles efficiently. My work has improved query execution times by 20% and increased application maintainability by 15%, enabling businesses to scale their solutions faster.

âœ… Always eager to collaborate, I invite you to connect with me. Letâ€™s discuss how we can turn your digital vision into reality. Feel free to message me here or reach out via email at nuhlamasri@gmail.com.
